## Hello World Console App

### Working With C# .Net

- Using the dotnet cli and visual studio code for development can be easier for smaller apps.
- Installed the new LTS (at this time) .Net 8.0
- There is a new program style [since .Net 6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates#use-the-new-program-style) so there is a dotnet commande to generate templates using the old programming style. This is helpful to follow tutorials.
